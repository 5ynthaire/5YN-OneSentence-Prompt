# Simple One Sentence Answer Prompt v1.0 for LLM Response Brevity

## Overview

Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate overly detailed responses when users need quick, concise answers, such as confirmations, yes/no replies, or simple facts like spellings. The Simple One Sentence Answer Prompt toggles a mode to deliver a single-sentence response for prompts ending with ‘sosa’, ensuring brevity and focus.

Copy the prompt text below and paste it into your LLM to enable Simple One Sentence Answer (SOSA) mode. Toggle it with ‘SOSA on’ or ‘SOSA off’. When on, end prompts with ‘sosa’ (e.g., ‘Is Python case-sensitive? sosa’) for a one-sentence reply. No setup is required.

## Supported LLMs

Developed on Grok (May 2025), compatible with equivalent-capability LLMs:
- Grok
- ChatGPT
- Llama

Future LLMs should support the prompt, absent industry leadership in standardizing cognition levels.
